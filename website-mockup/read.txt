Project: Node.js Authentication Mockup  
Author: Mehedi Hasan

Description:
---------------
This project is a mockup (ready-to-use) Node.js setup for authentication and user management.  
I added this project to GitHub as a ZIP file instead of a normal branch because the "node_modules" folder contains a large number of files, which makes it heavy for pushing directly to Git.

When I create a new Node.js project, I can reuse this setup as a base template — just unzip it, install dependencies, and start coding.

Folder & File Details:
-----------------------

📁 controllers/
   └── authController.js
       → Contains authentication logic (login, signup, logout, etc.)

📁 models/
   ├── db.js
       → Handles database connection setup (example: MongoDB or MySQL)
   └── userModel.js
       → Defines user schema/model for authentication and data storage

📁 routes/
   └── authRoutes.js
       → Defines all authentication-related routes (login, register, etc.)
       → Uses functions from `authController.js`

📁 views/
   ├── index.ejs
       → Main template (homepage or base page)
   ├── pages/
       → Contains page-level EJS files (like login, register, dashboard)
   ├── partials/
       → Contains reusable template parts (header, footer, navbar)
   ├── script/
       → JavaScript files for client-side logic
   └── style/
       → CSS or styling files

Additional Notes:
------------------
- The `node_modules` folder is not included to keep the project lightweight.
- To use the project:
  1. Unzip the folder.
  2. Run `npm install` to reinstall dependencies.
  3. Start the server using `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`.

Purpose:
--------
This mockup helps me quickly set up a new Node.js project with authentication structure, saving setup time for future projects.
